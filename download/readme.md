The windows version of the parser can be downloaded from here:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/raidloot/parser.zip

The download file contains winparser.exe which can open up spell files to be parsed on your own computer.

The first time you run the parser will you get a "Windows protected your PC" alert. This is called SmartScreen and protects your PC from running programs from unrecognized publishers - which is what I am. If you want to run the parser you will need to click the "More Info" link on the popup and then "Run anyway".

You will also need to have Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 installed to run the parser. This is a windows add-on that you may be missing if you have an older version of windows. If you run the parser and it doesn't work for you, download the required windows update from here:
