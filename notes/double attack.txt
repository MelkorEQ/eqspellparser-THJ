If you have an item with Ferocity (SPA 177 - Double Attack Chance), but do not have either the Double Attack skill or SPA 225 (Burst of Power - Grant Double Attack), Double Attack won't work.

If you have Burst of Power, you can get a bonus from Ferocity as well.
Interestingly, the chance to double attack is slightly different if you do not have the skill.

Chance to Double Attack:

    If you do not have the Double Attack skill or SPA 225 (Burst of Power), exit
    If you have the Double Attack skill, Chance = Skill + Level (PC Level). Otherwise, Chance is 0.
    Bonus = 500 * SPA 225 / 100
    Chance += Bonus
    If you have SPA 177 (Ferocity),
    Chance += Chance * SPA 177 / 100
    Roll 1-500. If you roll below your chance, it's a successful Double Attack.

Written more simply: *Only include Skill + Level if Skill > 0

DoubleAttackChance = (Skill + Level)* + 500 * SPA 225 / 100
DoubleAttackChance += DoubleAttackChance * SPA 177 / 100
DoubleAttackChance /= 500

For a level 70 Bard in DoN with Ferocity V and Burst of Power 5:
Skill = 0
Level = 70
SPA 225 = 15
SPA 177 = 15
Chance = 17.2%

For a level 120 Bard in ToL with Ferocity XIII (or higher) and Burst of Power 62 (from TDS, or higher):
Skill = 250
Level = 120
SPA 225 = 45
SPA 177 = 21
Chance = 143.8%
