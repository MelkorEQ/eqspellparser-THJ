No. It goes by spell effect first, then Value, then slot.

SPA 55 = Normal Runes. 100% damage absorption Melee & Spell.
SPA 78 = Spell Runes. 100% damage absorption Spell only. (This isn't used much).
SPA 161 = Spell Guard. Variable % damage absorption. Spell only.
SPA 162 = Melee Guard. Variable % damage absorption. Melee only.
SPA 450 = DoT Guard. Variable % damage absorption. DoT only.
SPA 451 = Melee Threshold. Variable % damage absorption over flat amount. Melee only.
SPA 452 = Spell Threshold. Variable % damage absorption over flat amount. Spell only.

So, for Melee, EQ will check SPA 55 first, then 162, then 451.
If you have two SPA 55 runes, it will take the higher slot since they are both 100% damage absorption.
If you have two SPA 162 runes, it will take whichever is the higher percent absorption first. If they are the same %, then it goes by spell slot.
The same applies to 451.

For Spells, EQ will check SPA 55 first, then 78, then 161, then 452, following the same rules as mentioned.

SPA 450 is the only DoT Rune, and it works the same as 161/162, but for DoTs. The higher number is because it was added much, much later.
