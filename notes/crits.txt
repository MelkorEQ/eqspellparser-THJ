Here's an explanation of how critical hits work:

If it's an NPC
- NPCs can't crit except for pets
- Get the leader's SPA 218 (pet crit chance)
- If we roll within that chance, use default crit mod (170%)
- Add SPA 474 (pet crit mod), 330 (crit base dmg %), 496 (crit base dmg % - non stacking)
*** - If the leader has luck, roll for an additional crit mod bonus
- Add 5 damage
- Multiply crit mod, damage done

If it's not an NPC
- if it's a level 12+ WAR/BER, RNG using archery, or ROG using throwing, they can crit
- get total SPA 169 (crit chance)
- if it's possible for us to crit (meet above qualifications or have some amount of crit chance SPA), roll:
- get SPA 219 (Slay Undead)
- If NPC is undead
- If PC has a buff or AA with Slay Undead, get crit mod from that spell
- if we qualify for the Slay Undead roll:
- add 5 damage, multiply by the SPA 219 mod (from AA or Holy Forge)

- get attacker and defender DEX mod:
- if DEX > 255 anything higher returns 20% of its value
- add 45
if attacker is not in (WAR, BER/ROG not throwing, RNG not using archery)
- multiply DEX mod by 3, divide by 5
- multiply DEX mod by total SPA 169
roll from 1 to 3400 (archery), 1100 (throw), 8900 (everything else)

if roll is less than DEX mod, we crit
- add 5 damage
- using default crit mod (170%)
- add SPA 330, 496
- roll luck for additional crit mod bonus
- multiply dmg by mod
- if victim is an NPC and attacker has SPA 440 (Finishing Blow) and victim is the right level
- get finishing blow chance, roll
- using max % HP possible to be done by this rank of Finishing Blow, if NPC is low enough HP, get the DMG from Finishing Blow

- if attacker is a ROG standing behind the victim
- chance = ROG's level * 12 // ROG have 100% chance to Deadly Strike from behind at lvl 100
- roll 1000, if it's less than the chance, multiply damage by 2

- get total SPA 171 (Crippling Blow)
- roll 100, if it's less than SPA 171 we get a Crippling Blow
- if attacker is a PC using Holy Forge and victim is undead, 20% chance of getting a Crippling Blow

- if attacker is in a berserk frenzy or got a successful Crippling Blow from Holy Forge
- add 19% damage
- calculate chance to resist bash
- if you roll successfully, stun victim 2 seconds

- if it's not a Deadly Strike, set the critical hit flag
- otherwise, calculate assassinate chance:
- if we have SPA 345 (Assassinate max level), the victim is humanoid, and the attacker is at least 60
- get chance to assassinate - (DEX capped at 255)
- add 5
- add SPA 349 (Assassinate)
- roll 1000, if we were successful get dmg from SPA 349 (Assassinate base 2)
- cap dmg at 6000000
