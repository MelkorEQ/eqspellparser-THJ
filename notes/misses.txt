    “What is the calculation for a miss? (Not taking into account blocks/parry, dodge, or riposte. Just the hit/miss calculation.)”

Start with "Computed Defense" from this https://forums.daybreakgames.com/eq/index.php?threads/ac-vs-acv2.210028/#post-3078126
- reduce if you're throwing/shooting a target in PVP
- roll Offense (based on Offense skill + Weapon skill)
- reduce if inebriated
- give a bonus if it's a BER
- EQ math ((+ 10 * 121) / 100)
- Add SPA 518, 216 (Accuracy)
- Multiply by SPA 184 (chance to hit)
- add a small Offense bonus if the attacker is a low level NPC
- roll avoidance (using Computed Defense)
- if the Offense roll is higher than the Defense roll, it's a hit, otherwise it's a miss
