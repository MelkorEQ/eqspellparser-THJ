# This is a fork of Raidloot's spell parser for The Heros Journey EQ Emu Server

This version was updated to support the spell file format used on the server, provide raw and descriptive spell data, and described custom effects as discovered.

To use, download the zip, unpack, naviagte to the Winparser folder and copy Winparser.exe, EQSpellParser.dll, and lzma.dll to your EQ Emu client folder. Launch Winparser.exe and choose the spell file found. You can search by spell name or ID.

* Note: the command line version does not build at this time and has not been updated, only the GUI version.
